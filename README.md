# RFM-Analysis

This analysis was done to understand consumer behaviour by segmenting them based on their purchasing patterns or habits as opposed to solely analysing how much money a customer spends with the business. 

The dataset was contained into two excel files. One file contained the *sales data*, with over 300,000 rows while the other excel workbook contained the *segmentation template* as agreed with the business owners, on what groups to segment the customers based on the final scores.

After validating the data and ensuring optimum data quality, both tables were imported into Power BI.

## First Step 
-	Created key measures such as R value, F value, M value using DAX formulas.

**R value** represents the difference between the customers last purchase date and the current date.

**F value** represents the count of customer transactions.

**M value** represents the total amount a particular customer has spent with the business.

- Created a new table called “**RFM Table**” using the “*SUMMARIZE*” DAX function, with R, F and M values as columns.

## Second step
- A score of **1 to 5 (from worst to best)** was assigned to customers in each of the three categories (using calculated columns) depending on the percentile where each RFM value falls.

![F SCORE DAX](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115559534/220897776-b764392d-7b15-48e1-b86a-19c580d071b9.jpg)

![M SCORE DAX](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115559534/220897817-be90bbee-504f-41f1-b8a0-f4fc4911b0d9.jpg)

- Based on each R, F, and M value, the “best” customer would receive a top score in every category i.e., (the higher the number, the better the result). However, this rule does not apply to the (R) recency value because the higher the number, the longer the customer did not make purchases. Therefore, *larger numbers get lower values* from 1 to 5.

## Third step
- After assigning an R score, F score and M score to each RFM value, another calculated column was created named “**RFM Score**” whose values were generated by combining all scores from the three categories.

## Fourth step
-	Created a relationship between the segment table and the RFM Table using the RFM score column present in both.

## Fifth Step
- Designed the dashboard using suitable visuals e.g. scatterplot, bar chart, multi row cards. I made sure that each visual answered potential business questions that may arise.

## INSIGHTS

- Customers categorised as **“Potential Loyalist” & “Promising”** make up **30%** of the company’s customer base, while those categorized as **“Cannot lose them”, “At risk”, “About to sleep” & ”Need Attention”** make up **32%** of the customer base.

- Customers segmented as **"Promising”** shop with the company just **once per year** on average, with their most recent purchase occurring on average, **94 days ago**. Additionally, the maximum amount spent by a customer in this category can be as high as $242, with a decent average spend per transaction of $13.84.

- Customers segmented as **"At risk"** shop with the company **four times per year** on average, with their most recent purchase occurring on average, **281 days ago**. While the maximum amount spent by a customer in this category can be as high as $137, the average spend per transaction is $10.90.

- Customers segmented as **"Need Attention"** shop with the company **twice per year** on average, with their most recent purchase occurring on average, **81 days ago**. While the maximum amount spent by a customer in this category can be as high as $90, the average spend per transaction is $10.37.

  ## RECOMMENDATIONS

  #### Potential Loyalists and Promising Customers (30% of the customer base):

  - These customers have shown the potential for loyalty, therefore we should consider implementing a customer loyalty program. e.g, Offer rewards, discounts, or exclusive access to encourage them to shop more frequently.
 
  - We can keep them engaged by sending them personalized recommendations, exclusive offers, and updates on new products to encourage repeat purchases.
 
  - Since some of them have a high maximum spend, we can target them with premium or high-value product recommendations.

#### Cannot Lose Them, At Risk, About to Sleep, and Need Attention Customers (32% of the customer base):

- We should prioritize re-engagement campaigns for these customers. Send out personalized emails or notifications to remind them of the company's products and encourage them to come back.

- Tailor campaigns based on their shopping behavior. For example, **"At Risk"** customers may likely respond well to win-back offers, while **"Need Attention"** customers may appreciate product recommendations.

- We can encourage **"At Risk" & "Need Attention"** customers to shop more often by offering incentives for multiple purchases.

- Cross-sell or upsell relevant products, bundle items, or offer discounts on higher-value purchases to help increase average spend per transaction.

- Create personalized offers based on their purchase history, such as recommending complementary products or items they've shown interest in.
